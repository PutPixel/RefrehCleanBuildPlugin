# RefrehCleanBuild Plugin

If you suffer from 'The project was not built due to "Could not delete..." Fix the problem, then try refreshing this project and building it since it may be inconsistent' (remember to switch off windows indexing Right click on root folder where all your workspaces are stored -> Properties -> Extended -> Disable Allow Indexing -> Apply recursively if you on windows)

Or have to do refresh - clean - build after each update from repository, then this plugin does all work for you.

It automatically refreshes and clean entire workspace until error specified above exists and then builds workspace.
If any other error exists then plugin shows error.
